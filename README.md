# Houdini Vex Help

This extension mimic the behaviour of the wrangle nodes "open help from selected text".

## Features

Select a function name in your code, run the command "Open Vex Help" from the command palette (ctrl+shift+p) or press F2, and it opens the help pages from the Houdini help of the function you selected.

## Requirements

Houdini must be installed on your machine.

This extension is very handy to use with the VEX language support for VSCode by [Mel Massadian](https://github.com/melMass/vscode-vex).

In order to use VSCode seamlessly on your wrangle node, you can use the plugin [HoudiniExprEditor](http://cgtoolbox.com/houdini-expression-editor/) from www.cgtoolbox.com.



## Extension Settings

Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: enable/disable this extension
* `myExtension.thing`: set to `blah` to do something
